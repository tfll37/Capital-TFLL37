### About me

#### The Story:

My name is Mark K., and I am an international student at the Technical University of Munich(TUM).

I started "fooling around" with cybersecurity topics at a very early age (5th grade in elementary school), and since then, I have been trying to polish my skills. 

I love playing CTFs and joining the team "\x4247Sec" (even as a complete beginner, back then) really helped me develop myself in this sphere. Despite being quite busy with the already very demanding university, I still try to find ways to solve CTFs.

 When I am not actively playing CTFs, I work on my projects, which are currently in the following fields:
- LLM research
- Malware
- Obfuscation
- 
#### About this blog:

I have no prior experience managing a blog, but as I prepare to apply for jobs, I realize having a technical portfolio would be valuable for showcasing my skills and enhancing my opportunities.

In this blog, I will publish interesting technical projects.

THIS BLOG IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT
